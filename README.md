# Human-Powered-Installation
This is the repository for human-powered art installation. This installation is currently in progess. It seeks to create magic through play. Essential parts will be the generation of energy and the magic use of elements, motion, light, and sound.

Please check out the (Wiki)[https://github.com/LSanten/Human-Powered-Installation/wiki] to learn more. Code will be uploaded if necessary.
